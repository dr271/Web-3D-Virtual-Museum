# Web-3D-Virtual-Museum
Built a X3D based Virtual Museum exploiting HTML5, CSS3, X3D (X3DOM), JavaScript , jQuery, Bootstrap 4, AJAX for asynchronous update of HTML contents, JSON for data transfer from the backend to the frontend, PHP to access data from a SQLite database, and all configured in a MVC design pattern. And, of course, a selection of 3D Models made by myself.
